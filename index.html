                        the
                        Red Queen. To her surprise, she lost sight of her in a moment, and found <br> herself walking in
                        at
                        the front-door again.</p>


                    <p class="set">For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all directions over
                        <br> the
                        country - and a most curious country it was.

                        deep, a <br> quantity of acorns, dates, chestnuts and other mast or vegetables, whereof these
                        animals are <br> fondest then you drive.</p>

                        the <br> wind, which, however, made its way into the comfortless room through the numerous
                        chinks in <br> the door.</p>
